            Khar (alkali) is a traditional food adjuvant of all Assamese people
            and all the inhabitants of Assam. Natural Khar is prepared by
            filtering water through the ashes of pseudostem, corm and fruit skin
            of banana named Bhimkol in Assamese (a seeded banana variety). The
            parts of banana plant are dried under sun. Fully dried plant parts
            are burnt and the ashes are collected and filtered with water. The
            residue collected is Khar. Khar is used to make different types of
            dishes like fish curry, meat curry, papaya curry & different types
            of vegetable dishes etc. Khar is served as a part of the main
            Assamese meal. According to the belief of indigenous people Khar has
            also medicinal uses like cleaning stomachs and curing gastric
            problems etc.

            <img class="foodImages" src="./foods/masor tenga.jpg" alt="" />
            Masor Tenga is quintessentially Assamese. We eat this delicate,
            tangy fish curry – Tenga means sour and Masor means with fish – in
            almost every summer and winter meal. One reason for this is that it
            isn’t complicated to make. With a handful of everyday ingredients,
            it can be prepared in no more than 15-20 minutes. In summer, we add
            fresh lime as the souring agent and in winter, wood apple or tangy
            robust heritage tomatoes. I would recommend Masor Tenga to anyone
            trying our cuisine for the first time: savour it with hot steaming
            rice and a crisp fritter of eggplant or pumpkin as an accompaniment.

            <img class="foodImages" src="./foods/alopitika.jpg" alt="" />
            Pitika is an Assamese word which means mashed. Pitika dishes are
            very popular in Assam. It is a side dish and a signature recipe of
            Assamese cuisine. Assamese people love to eat vegetables by mashing
            them with chopped onion, chilli and mustard oil after boiling or
            smoking/grilling them. Its taste is very pure. Sometimes raw onion
            is used and sometimes fried onion is used in these recepies. We use
            mustard oil for all purposes as it can also be consumed as raw.
            Pickled chilli or pickled bhut jolokia adds more taste to these
            dishes.

            Traditionally, this dish is considered to be a delicacy cooked and served on special occasions like Bihu, feast or for special guests. Even now-a-days, this dish is still integral part of any celebration or festivities.In Assam, the best season to eat duck meat is considered to be from Kaati Maah (late October) till Bohag (Early April). During this time frame, normally all domesticated ducks gorge on the freshly harvested rice grain residues and small fishes in the pond or bils (small lake) and become quite matured with meat and fat. In fact, in the villages of Assam, people used to select which duck to catch for dinner depending upon the speed at which a duck runs in its fol
